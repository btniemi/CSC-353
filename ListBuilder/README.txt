HOW TO USE LIST BUILDER PROJECT GUIDE:

1) sign in to your own account from the first page that pulls up when going to the site
2) after signing in you have access to creating lists and or recipes from the welcome page
3) once selected as a new product user you will need to create your first list by clicking the appropriate button to take you there on that page (list or recipe)
4) you will follow the steps it takes you on for creating a new list/recipe
5) if at any time you make mistakes you can click the button to take you back to your lists or recipes main page and there will be edit options for you
6) once list are created you can view them, and edit them (either recipes or lists)
7) if you complete something on a list you can always edit that list to delete that item you do not need or have a reason to have on the list as well
note: most of the steps are pretty linear within the outline of the website but there are buttons to go back to initial pages or main pages for each the list or recipe if you at any time wanted to not finish something and they can be edited upon


This is a very basic concept just to be able to creat a list, but there are some aspects I did not get to that I listed below that were on my to do list.
Of course there is probably more I would add as I thought of things later on as well.

THINGS I WANTED TO DO BUT DID NOT GET TIME TO FIGURE OUT
how to print the lists if needed.
being able to send them to other users or even your own phone so you can use this away from a desktop computer
having header tabs at the top instead of buttons might create better flow and functionality
